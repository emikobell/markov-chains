to be light winds all the way across,” he said. “I hate the thought
of going into steam at my time of life, but there’s no denying that
a couple of screws aft there would be a big help just now. If I knew

over, son, for the next voyage. It’s maddening to think of all the
cargoes awaiting bottoms back home, and us wallowing along at five or
six knots; and in ballast, at that!”
